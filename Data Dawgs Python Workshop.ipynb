    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry. Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. This is surprising given the fact that Python was not originally designed for data analysis or scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it. For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "* [IPython/Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, this tutorial was composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above list is just a sample of all the third party libraries out there. Always remember that if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package in Python that will do it for you. However, in order to tap into the power of this data science ecosystem, one must first have a familiarity with the Python language itself."
